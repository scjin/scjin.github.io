__Po-Ying Fu__,
Bioinformatics Research Analyst, Washington University in St. Louis 

Po-Ying obtained her master's degree in microbiology specialized in bioinformatics from Soochow University. In her master's thesis, she performed genomics analysis and used cell biology approaches to reveal the anti-cancer ability of lipopolysaccharide binding peptides. To advance her programming skills, she completed several advanced computer science courses at 42 Silicon Valley (a software engineering school) and Ohlong College.  She loves cycling and traveling!

__Kareena Joshipura__,
Mount Holyoke College's Lynk Fellow

Kareena is a rising senior at Mount Holyoke College, studying Statistics and Biology. Her passion to pursue these interdisciplinary subjects culminated in a course she took last year that applied probabilistic disease modeling to the current COVID-19 pandemic. She is working on an independent project that explores the impact invasive species have on native lands. On campus, Kareena is the captain of the South Asian dance team that participates in inter-collegiate events.She is also an executive board member of a sub-committee of the Student Government Association that works closely with students and faculty for the enhancement of student life on campus. Outside of coursework, Kareena spends her time watching videos on ‘How Things Work’ and being outdoors with her friends.
