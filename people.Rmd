__Po-Ying Fu__,
Bioinformatics Research Analyst 

Po-Ying obtained her master's degree in microbiology specialized in bioinformatics from Soochow University. In her master's thesis, she performed genomics analysis and used cell biology approaches to reveal the anti-cancer ability of lipopolysaccharide binding peptides. To advance her programming skills, she completed several advanced computer science courses at 42 Silicon Valley (a software engineering school) and Ohlong College.  She loves cycling and traveling!

__Devin Qiu__,
Research Assistant

Devin obtained his first master's degree in Plant Biotechnology from Cornell University and his second master's degree in Biomedical Informatics from Washington Univeristy in St. Louis. During his master's study at WashU, he performed single-cell RNA-sequencing genomic analysis to define genomic profile of lung stromal and immune cells in post-viral lung disease and build a risk evaluation model to predict the effect of chronic kidney disease history, comorbidities, and other demographic factos on the severity of COVID-19 patients. He loves playing video games.
