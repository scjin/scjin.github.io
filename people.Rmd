__Shohaib Shaffiey__,
M.Sc. Student (Computer Science), Washington University in St. Louis

Shohaib is currently an M.Sc. Student in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. He graduated with a BS in Biological Engineering from the University of Missouri - Columbia and with a M.Sc. in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins University.  He's interested in applying linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to preprocess high dimensional genomic data sets so that machine learning techniques can be better applied to them.  He's also interested in applying Machine Learning algorithms on genomic and proteomic data to predict gene expression, protein structure and function, phylogenetic tree formation, coding, non-coding, and regulatory regions of genes.

__Po-Ying Fu__,
Bioinformatics Research Analyst, Washington University in St. Louis 

Po-Ying obtained her master's degree in microbiology specialized in bioinformatics from Soochow University. In her master's thesis, she performed genomics analysis and used cell biology approaches to reveal the anti-cancer ability of lipopolysaccharide binding peptides. To advance her programming skills, she completed several advanced computer science courses at 42 Silicon Valley (a software engineering school) and Ohlong College.  She loves cycling and traveling!

__Kesava Viswanadha__,
Summer Intern

Kesava is currently a senior in high school. He is very interested in exploring the convergence of computer science and medicine, and this interest can be seen through his activities and awards in high school. He's consistently participated in competitions like the Brain Bee (multiple time finalist) and CyberPatriot (Top 12 Nationally), and been involved in several Data Science internships. Having exhausted his high school's computer science classes, he's taken numerous computer science courses at his local community college. He's been admitted to top engineering programs for undergrad and he's currently deciding where he should go. He loves recreationally playing basketball and biking!

__Kareena Joshipura__,
Summer Intern

Kareena is a rising senior at Mount Holyoke College, studying Statistics and Biology. Her passion to pursue these interdisciplinary subjects culminated in a course she took last year that applied probabilistic disease modeling to the current COVID-19 pandemic. She is working on an independent project that explores the impact invasive species have on native lands. On campus, Kareena is the captain of the South Asian dance team that participates in inter-collegiate events.She is also an executive board member of a sub-committee of the Student Government Association that works closely with students and faculty for the enhancement of student life on campus. Outside of coursework, Kareena spends her time watching videos on ‘How Things Work’ and being outdoors with her friends.
