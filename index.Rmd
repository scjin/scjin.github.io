I receieved a BS in [Applied Mathematics](http://www.math.nctu.edu.tw/) from the National Chiao Tung University, and a ScM in Biostatistics from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public of Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/). I completed my Ph.D. with [Alison Goate](http://labs.neuroscience.mssm.edu/project/goate-lab/) and [Carlos Cruchaga](https://neurogenomics.wustl.edu/) at the Washington University in St. Louis and a post-doctoral training with [Richard Lifton](https://www.rockefeller.edu/about/executive-leadership/president/) at Yale and Rockefeller.

I was the lead computational biologist for the whole exome/genome sequencing and array genotyping analysis working groups in the [Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium](https://benchtobassinet.com/?page_id=17) and the [International Cerebral Palsy Genomics Consortium](https://icpgc.org). I also led genomic analysis and methodology development in several genetic studies of complex diseases, including congenital hydrocephalus, Vein of Galen malformation, Chiari malformation, trigeminal neuralgia, Dent disease, and arachnoid cyst for the [Yale Center for Mendelian Genomics](https://medicine.yale.edu/keck/ycga/mendelian/).

Supported by a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, I am currently in transition to my new role as an assistant professor in the [Department of Genetics at the Washington University in St. Louis](http://genetics.wustl.edu/) and will start my independent lab in April of 2020. I am interested in the formulation, development, and application of computational approaches to understand the complex genetic models driving congenital and neurological diseases and to begin characterizing genetic networks of disease via multi-dimensional omics data, biobank sources, and electronic health record data.

I am an avid R & Python enthusiast. My full CV is available [here](files/sjin-CV 08-18-2019 Detailed Format.pdf).
