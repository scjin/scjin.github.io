### Graduate Students

We welcome inquiries from Washington University Ph.D. students for rotation projects. We have a particular interest in students enrolled in any of our [12 Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences Ph.D. programs](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/). Students from other graduate programs at Washington University who are interested in our lab should verify their eligibility with their program administrators before contacting us.

According to Washington University regulations, we cannot accept any graduate trainees for direct admission into our lab. Therefore, you must first be accepted into one of the above programs before being considered for our lab. If you are interested, please send an email to jin810@wustl.edu. We strongly encourage interested students to reach out to current lab members to learn more about our research and lab environment.

### Undergraduate Students

We welcome inquiries for independent research and training opportunities throughout the academic year, including the summer. We primarily accept students through official Wash U. independent research courses such as [Bio 200/500](https://sites.wustl.edu/bio200500independentresearch/). However, there are also several programs available that provide paid summer research opportunities for both WashU and non-WashU undergraduates, including the [Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/admissions/summer-undergraduate-research-programs/), the [McDonnell Genome Institute](https://genome.wustl.edu/outreach/), and the [Office of Undergraduate Research](https://undergradresearch.wustl.edu/research-opportunities#anchor-group-10424). Additionally, the [Young Scientist Program](https://sites.wustl.edu/wustlysp/) is available for high school students in the St. Louis area.

### Postdoctoral Associate in Functional Genomics

The Jin Lab is seeking a talented and enthusiastic postdoctoral fellow to join our growing team in the Department of Genetics at Washington University School of Medicine. To tackle central questions about the pathophysiology of neuropathy, congenital hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and/or congenital heart defects, the fellow will conduct functional genomics research under the guiding aims:

* Characterization of biological mechanisms disrupted by pathogenic mutations
* Development of human disease models using massively parallel reporter assays and/or zebrafish model systems
* Implementation of multi-omics approach that integrate high-throughput imaging and machine learning coupled with CRISPR/Cas9 screens

Our interdisciplinary research environment brings together life scientists, computational biologists, and physician-scientists to identify mutations underlying human diseases and their pathogenic mechanisms with the ultimate goal of translating these findings into effective therapeutic treatments. For more information, please visit our lab webpage: https://scjin.github.io/

Required qualifications:

* Recent PhD/MD in a biological sciences or related fields (Molecular Biology, Developmental Biology, Cell Biology, Neurosciences, Biochemistry, etc.)
* Experience in the zebrafish handling, cell culture, neuroscience, and genomics
* Good communication skills
* In addition, applicants must be able to visit St. Louis for potential interviews

Applicants should email a single PDF file consisting of a letter of interest and CV, and should arrange for three letters of reference to be sent to Dr. Jin (jin810@wustl.edu).

### Postdoctoral Associate in Computational Genomics

The Jin lab is looking for an energetic and motivated individual to work as a Postdoctoral Associate with a doctoral degree in genetics, genomics, computational biology, or computer science to investigate the genetic basis of neuropathy, congenital hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and/or congenital heart defects.

Although advances in next-generation sequencing have discovered the genetic causes of a large proportion of patients with congenital disorders,the etiology of most cases remains unclear. It is becoming evident that simple genetic models do not entirely explain the causes of all congenital disorders and more nuanced approaches are required. Therefore, the Jin lab's research is focusing on the formulation and development of computational methods to determine the complex genetic basis underlying congenital disorders using human genetics, genomics, and advanced statistical methods. Our goal is to translate an improved molecular understanding of congenital disorders from the laboratory into clinically actionable models, diagnostics, and ultimately therapeutic interventions.

We are currently looking for researchers with a strong computational background in genomic and functional genomic analysis, including whole genome sequencing, single-cell RNA-sequencing, genetic association studies, and integrative analysis of genomic and functional genomic data. The candidate will be expected to plan and carry out research tasks independently and write-up/present findings on a regular basis.

The Jin lab is located in the Couch Biomedical Research building on the 5th floor in the Department of Genetics space. The successful candidate will take advantage of the unique collaborative relationships with the McDonnell Genome Institute, the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center, Departments of Pediatrics & Neuroscience, and across the broader research community of Washington University which provides outstanding training and educational opportunities. Dr. Jin is committed to mentoring and training the candidate, providing all the support the candidate needs to reach their career goals. For competitive candidates, references from current and previous trainees attesting to the supportive and dynamic research environment of the Jin lab are available upon request.

To be considered for this role, please email Dr. Jin at jin810@wustl.edu with the following items: 1) CV with a list of publications; 2) a short summary of your present and future research interests; 3) a list of three references with their contact information. Diverse expertise will be considered. Competitive salary and benefits will be provided
